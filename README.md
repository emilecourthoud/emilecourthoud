### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Meet [Emile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emile-courthoud/)!

I am the co-founder and COO of Nebuly, a fast-growing startup based in Silicon Valley and Italy.

I am a person who rarely sticks to the mainstream norms of today's society, but rather loves to explore new cultures, countries, technologies. I am used to frequent changes, both in where I live and in the activities I do. I've worked both in an ETH/Caltech team of brilliant computational mechanics researchers, in the highly regulated healthcare sector of a large Swiss corporate, and in an agile team of smart strategy consultants. 

Now, I've launched a startup that is growing very fast. It's called Nebuly, and its mission is to accelerate for as many developers as possible the transition to efficient computing that uses only the resources strictly necessary.
